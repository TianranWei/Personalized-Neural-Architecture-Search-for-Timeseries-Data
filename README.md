# Personalized-Neural-Architecture-Search-for-Timeseries-Data
## Introduction
When we make predictions for Time Series Data, a high Accuracy can be achieved due to the development of Machine Learning techniques. Additionally, personalization is another important issue in especially when users of the prediction system have different preferences for the prediction. 

According to the preference, the prediction model could achieve a performance improvement with the help of parametrization. Providing personalized model with high accuracy and usability to individual users is the goal we pursued. 

In this paper, we build experimentally a personalization framework, in which two representative ranking algorithms are implemented and compared. Our experiments are meant to simulate the procedure of personalizing Neural Architecture Search based on the Timeseries Data and evaluating the performance of different Ranking Algorithms.
